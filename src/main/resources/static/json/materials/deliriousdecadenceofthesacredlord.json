The first human to ascend, who at the time had not yet attained divine form, showed him great compassion.\nThus, after emerging from the mighty wing-shadows of a once-great race, he was accepted by the tribe who had once been his.\nSince then, he has concealed his true visage beneath a mask, hiding the golden patterns that mark it, and resolved to offer up everything to the master who holds his vow.",
