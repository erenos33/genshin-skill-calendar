	"description": "The bait is based on rose dew and has been mixed with sun-dried Harra Fruit powder. It has a spicy taste and a sweet aftertaste, just like the life of a fisherman. The harvest after going through all the weather-beaten days and roaring waves is particularly gratifying.\n\nSuitable for: Angler and Axe Marlin.",
