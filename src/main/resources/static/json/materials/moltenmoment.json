You obtained this from defeating La Signora, who unleashed her original power.\n\"I had a long, long dream.\"\n\"I dreamed that you and I met again in the pure white world that we created.\"\n\"But I woke up at last, having long been consumed by the raging flames, while you had long returned to the earth along with that poisoned blood.\"\n\"But none of it matters anymore. I must continue forging ahead. I must incinerate everything behind me. I must believe in that pure, spotless, everlasting realm that he spoke of â€” that I saw in the 'delusion' he let me see, at the end of the horizon of Her Majesty's dreams.\"",
