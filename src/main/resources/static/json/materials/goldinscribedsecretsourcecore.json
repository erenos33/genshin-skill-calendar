	"description": "This is a core component that separated from the body of a Secret Source Automaton: Configuration Device that lost its ability to move after being defeated.\nSome say that the cores that power all the Secret Source Automatons are the same type, and that they simply carry different information, as attested by the fact that the golden patterns on them are different. At first, the many commands were only added to the circuits to aid their smooth running, but it seems that all the superimposition and layering of orders onto one another has wound up creating a rudimentary artificial intelligence.",
