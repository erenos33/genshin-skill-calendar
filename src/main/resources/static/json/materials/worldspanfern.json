There, the ferns were the first to sprout in the lush verdant world of Apep's court.\nIn the ages after, these ferns would become trees, vines, roots, and leaves, blanketing the world with their touch. But Apep still remembers the first frond as it stretched freely toward the sky, making a sound so delicate as to go unheard.",
