	"description": "If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle at an accelerating rate and increase your chances of success. If you leave the Ideal Tension Zone, the acceleration will reset.\nA special fishing rod created for the sake of the Lunar Leviathan. To tackle this legendary fish, the creator of this rod specially added some material with rare functions onto the rod itself and the fishing line, giving it both great malleability and tensile strength. Of course, such a treasure could easily catch ordinary fish, but that seems like overkill to the point where even the rod might feel ashamed to be used thus.",
